# Repository for the paper “Investigating the fit between phonological feature systems and brain responses to speech using EEG”

This repository will host the data and code for the paper

> McCloy, DR & Lee, AKC. Investigating the fit between phonological feature
systems and brain responses to speech using EEG.

(currently under review).

The original development repository is at
https://github.com/drammock/eeg-phone-coding, which contains only code (not
data). As with many projects, it grew organically and consequently the repo is
not especially orderly. Refactoring and cleanup is underway, and the permanent
home of the code and data will be here.  This message will be updated
accordingly when that process is complete.
