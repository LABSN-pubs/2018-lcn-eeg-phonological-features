# Repository for the paper “Investigating the fit between phonological feature systems and brain responses to speech using EEG”

This repository will host the code for the paper

> McCloy, DR & Lee, AKC. Investigating the fit between phonological feature
systems and brain responses to speech using EEG.

(currently under review).

Raw EEG data related to this project is hosted on the Open Science Framework:
https://osf.io/kxqtc/files/


To reproduce the analyses here, clone this repository, download the `.tar.gz`
files that are in the `eeg-data-raw` folder on
[the OSF project webpage](https://osf.io/kxqtc/files/), put them in the folder
of the same name that is part of this repository, and run
`000_uncompress_data.sh`.

The original development repository is at
https://github.com/drammock/eeg-phone-coding. As with many projects, it grew
organically and consequently the repo is not especially orderly. Refactoring
and cleanup is underway, and the permanent home of the code will be here.
This message will be updated accordingly when that process is complete.
